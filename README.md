Contextually-Duplicating Spritesheet Editor

If you have a spritesheet with a bunch of pixel art images of the same character in different frames, you might want to make
some simple change like adding horns.  This app lets you make the edit once and have it appear everywhere where the image
looks like it did around where you edited.

The size of matching context required is controlled by the slider bar.

Editing is currently limited to setting pixels to one of the colors in the original palette, or "undo all".
